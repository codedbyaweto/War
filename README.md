# War Card Duel

War Card Duel is a lightweight card game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It uses the Deck of Cards API to fetch and draw real playing cards.  
Each round, two cards are drawn—one for the computer and one for the player.  
The higher card wins the round and earns a point. When the deck is empty,  
the game announces the final winner.
